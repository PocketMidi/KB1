## Firmware

This folder contains the current source code of the firmware for the KB1. 

* The code is built on top of the excellent [PlatformIO framework](https://platformio.org).
* Further details (project setup etc.) will be added in time.
* Reference material collected during the development of the firmware can be found [here](../references/firmware).

> Troubleshooting: See [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for PlatformIO upload fixes (e.g. installing `intelhex`).
